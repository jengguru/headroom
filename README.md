# Headroom

<img src="Resources/AppIcon.png" width="128" alt="Headroom icon">

**Show your AI subscription usage limits.**

A native macOS menu bar app that shows your subscription usage limits for **Claude** (shared by claude.ai and Claude Code) and **Codex** (ChatGPT plan limits for Codex CLI, IDE and cloud), and notifies you before you hit them.

- **Current session / 5h limit**: % used, % left, time until reset
- **Weekly limit**: % used, % left, time until reset
- Model-specific limits (Claude Opus / Sonnet weekly, extra Codex model limits) when your plan reports them
- Menu bar ring icon (outer ring = session, inner ring = weekly), with an optional `59%` label
- **Combined** menu bar icon (default): one icon showing whichever service is closest to its limit, with both services in one popover. Or **Separate**: one icon per service (Settings → Menu bar → Icons)
- macOS notifications at thresholds you set (default 75% and 90%), once per threshold per window, naming the service ("Codex weekly usage at 90%")
- Turn each service on or off, configurable refresh interval, launch at login

Requires macOS 13+ and at least one of:

- **Claude**: a Pro or Max plan, with Claude Code signed in (`claude` → `/login`)
- **Codex**: a ChatGPT plan that includes Codex (Plus, Pro, Business, …), with Codex CLI signed in with ChatGPT (`codex login`)

> **ChatGPT chat message limits are not shown.** Codex's usage endpoint doesn't report them and there is no known endpoint that does, so the Codex numbers cover Codex usage only, not messages in the ChatGPT app.

1. Unzip the file and move **Headroom.app** to **Applications**.
2. Headroom isn't notarized by Apple, so the first launch is blocked. Right-click the app → **Open** → **Open**. On macOS 15 or later, open it once, then go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.
3. Headroom appears in the menu bar. Click it, then the gear icon, to choose services and the menu bar style.

Each release is built by GitHub Actions from a tagged commit on `main`, never on someone's laptop. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) explains how to check that the file you downloaded is that build.

## Where the data comes from

### Claude

I compared four possible sources before building:

| Source | What it gives | Reliability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`** (used here) | `five_hour` / `seven_day` (+ `seven_day_opus`, `seven_day_sonnet`) `utilization` % and `resets_at` | The same data Claude Code's `/usage` command and claude.ai's usage page show. Authoritative, but **undocumented**, so it may change without notice. It rate-limits aggressive polling (HTTP 429). |
| Claude Code status line JSON (`rate_limits.five_hour.used_percentage`) | Same numbers | Available only inside a running Claude Code session, and only after its first API response. Good for a status line, not for a standalone app. |
| Local transcripts (`~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`, e.g. `ccusage`) | Token counts for Claude Code on this Mac | Can't produce a limit %: Anthropic doesn't publish plan limits in tokens, and usage from claude.ai, the mobile apps and other machines doesn't appear. |
| claude.ai web API with a browser `sessionKey` cookie | Same numbers | Needs you to copy a browser cookie that expires. Fragile, and it looks like scraping. |

**Chosen:** the OAuth usage endpoint, authenticated with Claude Code's own OAuth token:

- **Token:** read from the macOS Keychain item `Claude Code-credentials` (via `/usr/bin/security`). If that item doesn't exist, the app falls back to `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.credentials.json`). The first time, macOS asks whether `security` may read the item. Click **Always Allow**.
- **Request:** `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` and `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`.
- **Read-only:** the app **never refreshes or writes the token**. Refreshing would rotate Claude Code's refresh token and could sign Claude Code out. When the access token expires, the app shows a message. As soon as you use Claude Code again, it refreshes the token and the app picks it up automatically.
- **Polling:** every 5 minutes by default (2–30 is configurable). On a 429 the app backs off (it honours `Retry-After`, waits at least 2 minutes and at most 1 hour). The Refresh button respects the backoff.
- **Privacy:** the only Claude request goes to `api.anthropic.com`. The token stays in memory for the length of each request.

### Codex

**Chosen:** `GET https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`, the endpoint Codex CLI's `/status` command reads (checked against the [openai/codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) source, `codex-rs/backend-client`). It returns:

```json
{"plan_type": "plus",
 "rate_limit": {"allowed": true, "limit_reached": false,
   "primary_window":   {"used_percent": 42, "limit_window_seconds": 18000,  "reset_after_seconds": 3600,   "reset_at": 1790083980},
   "secondary_window": {"used_percent": 81, "limit_window_seconds": 604800, "reset_after_seconds": 400000, "reset_at": 1790480380}},
 "additional_rate_limits": [{"limit_name": "…", "metered_feature": "…", "rate_limit": {…}}]}
```

Windows are labelled the way Codex's `/status` labels them (`5h`, `weekly`, …, from `limit_window_seconds`). Windows up to a day long use your *session* thresholds; longer ones use your *weekly* thresholds.

- **Token:** read from `~/.codex/auth.json` (or `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`): `tokens.access_token`, plus `tokens.account_id`, which is sent as `ChatGPT-Account-Id` like Codex does. If there's no file and Codex is set to keep credentials in the Keychain (`cli_auth_credentials_store = "keyring"`), the app reads the `Codex Auth` Keychain item via `/usr/bin/security` instead, and macOS asks once.
- **Request:** `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`, `ChatGPT-Account-Id: <account_id>`.
- **Read-only:** like the Claude side, the app **never refreshes or writes** Codex's tokens (a refresh would rotate Codex's refresh token and could sign Codex out). When the token expires, using Codex once refreshes it and the app picks it up.
- **API-key logins** (`OPENAI_API_KEY` in auth.json) have no plan limits, so the app asks you to sign in with ChatGPT instead.
- **Polling and privacy:** same schedule and 429 backoff as Claude. The only Codex request goes to `chatgpt.com`, and only when a Codex sign-in exists. Error messages name JSON keys, never token values.

## Architecture

```
Sources/
  HeadroomCore/             Foundation only, unit tested
    UsageModels.swift       UsageProvider, UsageWindow / UsageSnapshot (shared by all providers)
    UsageFetching.swift     UsageFetcher protocol, shared HTTP status → error mapping
    Credentials.swift       file / Keychain (security CLI) sources + first-match loader
    Providers/Claude.swift  Claude Code credentials, /api/oauth/usage client + decoder
    Providers/Codex.swift   Codex auth.json credentials, /wham/usage client + decoder
    Thresholds.swift        once-per-window threshold alerts (hysteresis + reset detection)
    UsageFormatting.swift   "3h 27m", "Today at 16:00", % and colour levels
  Headroom/                 SwiftUI MenuBarExtra app (LSUIElement, no Dock icon)
    HeadroomApp.swift       MenuBarExtra scenes: one combined, or one per provider
    UsageStore.swift        per-provider @MainActor poll loop, backoff, error states
    PopoverView.swift       the popover UI
    SettingsPanel.swift     in-popover settings
    MenuBarIcon.swift       ring icon drawing + labels
    NotificationManager.swift  UNUserNotificationCenter
Tests/HeadroomCoreTests     decoding, credentials, thresholds, provider selection, formatting
Resources/AppIcon.svg       icon source (AppIcon.png is its 1024px render)
scripts/                    build-app.sh, smoke-test.sh, check-no-dependencies.sh
.github/workflows/          build.yml (every push), release.yml (v* tags)
```

Adding a provider means writing a `UsageFetcher` that returns a `UsageSnapshot`; thresholds, notifications, the menu bar and the popover work from the snapshot.

The combined icon shows the provider whose highest *primary* window (session or weekly) is highest. Model-specific windows don't count, because hitting one still leaves the other models available. On a tie it keeps the first provider (Claude), so the icon doesn't flicker. With more than one service turned on, the label names the service (`Codex 81%`). In separate mode each icon always shows its service's name, because the rings look the same for every service.

How threshold notifications work: each threshold fires once per usage window, tracked separately per service. It re-arms when the window's `resets_at` moves (a new window starts), or when usage drops more than 5 points below the threshold. If a single poll crosses several thresholds, you get one notification for the highest. Fired state is saved, so relaunching the app doesn't repeat alerts.

## Build & run

Needs Xcode 15+ (or its command line tools). Run the core unit tests, build `build/Headroom.app` (ad-hoc signed, with icon) and open it:

```sh
swift test
scripts/build-app.sh
open "build/Headroom.app"
```

Move the app to `/Applications` if you want **Launch at login**. CI (GitHub Actions, `macos-14`) runs the tests, builds a universal app with the hardened runtime, checks that it launches, and uploads `Headroom.zip` as a workflow artifact on every push.

### Publishing a release

Bump `CFBundleShortVersionString` in `Resources/Info.plist`, merge to `main`, then tag that commit on `main`:

```sh
git checkout main
git pull
git tag v0.3.0
git push origin v0.3.0
```

The **Release** workflow checks that the tag is on `main` and matches `Info.plist`, runs the tests, builds the app and publishes a GitHub Release with `Headroom.zip` and its SHA-256. The Download link above always points at the newest release.

## Troubleshooting

- **"No Claude Code sign-in found"**: install Claude Code, run `claude`, then `/login` with your Pro/Max account.
- **"No Codex sign-in found"**: install Codex CLI and run `codex login` with your ChatGPT account. If you don't use one of the services, turn it off in Settings → Services.
- **"Codex is signed in with an API key"**: API-key usage has no plan limits. Run `codex login` and choose **Sign in with ChatGPT**.
- **`CODEX_HOME` / `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` ignored**: apps opened from Finder don't see variables set in your shell profile. Use the default `~/.codex` / `~/.claude`, or start the app's binary from a Terminal that has them set: `build/Headroom.app/Contents/MacOS/Headroom`.
- **"Keychain access was denied"**: press Refresh and choose **Always Allow** in the prompt.
- **"sign-in token expired"**: use Claude Code or Codex once (any prompt) and it refreshes its token.
- **"Rate limited"**: the endpoint throttles frequent callers. The app retries automatically. Consider a longer refresh interval.

## Limitations / next steps

- Both endpoints are unofficial. If Anthropic or OpenAI changes one, parsing fails with a visible error instead of showing wrong numbers.
- **ChatGPT chat/message limits are not available**, only Codex limits.
- API-key usage (Anthropic Console, OpenAI API keys) is not covered: those accounts have no subscription windows.
- Ideas: a "limit reset" notification, a usage history sparkline, a status line bridge as a second data source.
